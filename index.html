                Zoro Quotations are quick and easy to create. Click the Add to Quotation button on any product page. You can then choose to create a new quotation or add the product to an existing one. Once created, quotations can easily be emailed, printed, and forwarded on. They can later be retrieved, updated, and turned into an order with just a few clicks. <br>

The key-feature of Zoro quotations is that they will lock the very best price for that product for 14 days. <br>

You do not need to create a Zoro account to create, manage or retrieve a quote.

                Quotations are most easily retrieved through your Zoro Account, simply navigate to Quotations using the account drop down or left-hand navigation under <span class="orange">your account</span> . Alternatively, if you don't have a Zoro Account, quotations can be retrieved using the quotation reference on the <span class="orange">Quotation page</span> 

                You can add or remove products from an existing quotation for 14 days. That's when your quote expires.
                
                You can recreate an expired quote at any time by clicking on the refresh icon in the quotation list under your account. The prices will get updated to the current website prices.

                Yes, you can add items to your quotation directly from the product page and at checkout. By selecting 'add to quotation' the product/s will be added to your list which you can view through your account and your active quotations, and your total price will be updated. To remove items, go to 'My Account' and then 'Quotations'. Here you will be given the opportunity to edit your quotation and remove items. Your total will be automatically updated.  Please Note: If you do not receive an email, Please check your spam folder.

Yes – Adding or removing items from your list will be reflected in your quotation total. The prices of any previously added items will remain the same.

                If items in an active quotation (within the 14 day period) drop for any reason, for example a promotion or sale on the website which alters the price of the products in your list, then your quotation total will automatically reflect this. You will always benefit from the lowest price – even if it increases again once the promotion has ended.

                Your quoted price will not change. Prices are automatically locked at the lowest amount and will only ever decrease if products become cheaper.
